# Arduino-Python Communication Project
This project demonstrates communication between a Python script and an Arduino Uno using USB (serial communication).

## Project Goal
- Establish a serial communication (USB) between the Arduino and the computer.
- Control a LED on the Arduino by sending commands from a Python script.

## Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno
- USB Cable
- LED (with appropriate resistor)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Required
- Python 3 (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/)
- pyserial library (Install using pip install pyserial in your terminal)
